# Simple Web Based Text Editor
By John Waugh

My goal with this project was to recreate a simple web based text editor which one might find online or on their computer. 


## Possible Improvements
- Allowing the user to highlight sections of text and then modify the text directly by clicking one of the buttons in the menu. For example, making a highlighted section of text bold, etc.
- Adding another menu bar which is formatted as a few dropdown buttons which allow the user to save files, undo/redo text, insert images/special characters, etc.
- Update the share feature to download a formatted version of the document, not just the raw text file, and also be able to share it across email.
